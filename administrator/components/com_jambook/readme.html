<h2>About the name</h2>
<p>The name Jambook is derived from the Swahili word "jambo", which means "hello", and the English word "book".</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once installed you will have a new menu option called Jambook under the component menu in the administrator page of Joomla. From this menu you can List items, Approve new items, administer the component, read information, change the configuration etc.</p>


<h3>Frontend Usage Information</h3>
<p>The main page of Jambook shows a list of the guestbook entries. How this list is sorted, how many entries are shown per page, where the entry field is shown etc are all changeable in the Jambook configuration available from Joomla Administrator.</p>

<h4>Search</h4>
<p>Jambook has a built in search function to allow users to enter a text string to find all entries containing that string. If any entries are found they will show in a list similar to the normal guestbook entry list. If you want the main Joomla search page to search Jambook entries as well you will need the Jambook Searchbot, which can be downloaded separately.</p>

<h4>Write guestbook entry</h4>
<p>The guestbook entry form will either be shown above or below the guestbook entries, or on a separate page, depending on the 'Entry Form Placement' configuration option under the Posting configuration page of Jambook. The administrator can choose whether a preview page will be shown prior to saving the entry, and if a thank you email should be sent when the entry has been entered. It is also possible for the administrator to receive a notification of all entries entered.</p>


<h3>Administrator Usage Information</h3>
<p>When clicking on the main Jambook menu item in the Joomla Administrator Component menu a control page listing a description of each of the administration pages, as well as some information about the component. Below is a detailed description of each of these pages. This page reads the latest Jambook version from a central server on the internet.</p>

<h4>Guestbook Entries</h4>
<p>On this page all guestbook entries are listed and can be modified by the administrator. This is the page where entries can be approved by publishing them and it is also possible to edit entries and create new entries. This list works in the same way as the normal Joomla content editing list. To edit a guestbook entry, click on its title or mark the checkbox and click on the "Edit" icon. Click on the "New" icon to add a new guestbook entry. Several entries can be published, unpublished or deleted at the same time by marking the checkboxes next to them and clicking on the appropriate icon. To mark all checkboxes on the current page, click on the checkbox in the header field.</p>

<h5>Add/Edit Guestbook Entries</h4>
<p>The forms to Add and Edit a guestbook entry works in the same way, when a guestbook entry is edited all fields will be pre-filled with the values of that posting.</p>

<p>The fields are the same as when writing an entry from the frontend, except that there is a tab for publishing parameters. It is possible to publish entries, set a specific time the entry will be published or unpublished, and it is also possible to change the date when the entry was posted.</p>

<p>When editing a guestbook entry, it will be checked out and no other user will be able to edit it until it has been saved or the cancel icon has been clicked.</p>


<h4>Template Manager</h4>
<p>This shows a list of the available template files in the currently selected template set. To edit the contents of a template file, just click on the name of the item. It is not possible to add or remove template files, as they are used internally by the component.</p>

If the template file is writeable a green "Writeable" text is shown above the field, if the system won't be able to save the template a red "Unwriteable" text is shown above the field instead. If the latter is shown you need to change the file permissions on the file shown to be able to save this template file from the administrator page. Click on the 'Save' button to save the template, or 'Cancel' to discard any changes.</p>

<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>This component includes a template system for the html output of frontend pages. Two different sets of templates are included with the component and it's possible to switch between these from the component configuration. Each template file can also be changed via the component Administration. It's only possible to edit the content of template files in the currently selected template set.</p>

<p>The template files are normal HTML files, but also uses functionality similar to Joomla Mambots to make it possible to show where dynamic data should be placed.</p>

<h3>Availableable Template Mambots</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>{jxtvalue=XXX}</b></dt>
<dd>Prints the content of the variable XXX. All job database fields are added as variables, as well as some other useful values. The available variables available are different for each template file.</dd>
<dt><b>{jxtlang=XXX}</b></dt>
<dd>Prints the language string XXX. This can be any language string available in Joomla and the component.</dd>
<dt><b>{jxtshowif=XXX} Any content {/jxtshowif}</b></dt>
<dd>Only shows the content between opening and closing mambots if variable XXX contains a value.</dd>
<dt><b>{jxtshowifnot=XXX} Any content {/jxtshowifnot}</b></dt>
<dd>Shows the content if the variable XXX <i>doesn't</i> contain a value.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>N.B.</b> The jxtshowif and jxtshowifnot template mambots can't be nested, as it will only work from the opening mambot to the first occurence of closing mambot.</p>
<p>Please look at the content of the provided template files for more information on how to use this template system.</p>
<p>It's also possible to get configuration values, by adding "config_" in front of key name of the configuration value.</p>
