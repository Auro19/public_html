<p>The Session Details page contains fields for specifying all aspects of a session -- mandatory fields are marked with a red asterisk.  The upper left-hand portion of the page contains a text field for naming the session, and a WYSIWYG editor for describing it.  The upper-right hand area allows the selection of a session host, and the specification of an associated event (if integrated with the Events component).  The session's status is displayed also displayed.  Depending on configuration options, the a session's status may affect if it is visible in the front-end.  However, a session's <i>Published</i> attribute must be <i>true</i> for it to appear in the front-end (regardless of other configuration options).  The lower portion of the page contains a tab pane with parameters relating to where the session occurs (see <b>Venue</b>), who can register for it (see <b>Registration</b>), and what information needs to be collected (see <b>Fields</b>).

<h3>Registration</h3><p>The fields on the <i>Registration</i> tab control the duration of the registration period and who can register.  Like the <i>General</i> tab, the dates and times on which the registration period begins and ends must be specified.  Registration may be open to everyone or restricted to registered users only, or guests only.  An optional capacity may be specified.  A value of zero (0) indicates an unlimited number of spaces.</p>

<h3>Fields</h3><p>Attend Events has three built-in registration fields: <i>Name</i>, <i>Email Address</i> and <i>Number of People</i>.  Any additional information that needs to be collected at registration must be accomplished by creating additional registration fields in the <i>Fields</i> tab.  Depending on your <i>Configuration</i> settings, the list may include a default set of fields.  To add additional fields, click the "New Field" icon in the top left hand corner.  To delete fields, click the red "X" at the left side of the row.  Similarly, the order in which fields are displayed can be changed by clicking the blue up and down arrows on each row (these arrows are only visible when re-ordering is possible!).  For each field, you must provide a name and select a type from the drop down menu.  The list of "Type Specific Parameters" will change depending on the field type you selected.  For convenience, the options can be collapsed by clicking the expand/collapse button in the top left corner of each type specific option grouping.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Required</dt>
<dd>If <i>true</i>, the user must fill-in this field before the registration form can be submitted.</dd>
<dt>Default</dt>
<dd>A default value that will appear in the field when the registration form is displayed to the user.</dd>
<dt>Associated Community Builder Field</dt>
<dd>If this field of a user's Community Builder profile contains an acceptable value, it is used instead of the form's default.<b>Only available when integrated with the Community Builder component.</b></dd>
<dt>Tooltip</dt>
<dd>The text of a tooltip which can be displayed beside the field in the front end.  Leaving this blank means no tooltip will be displayed.</dd>
<dt>Size</dt>
<dd>The visible size of the text field.</dd>
<dt>Maximum Length</dt>
<dd>The total number of characters that the text field can contain.</dd>
<dt>Rows/Cols</dt>
<dd>Specifies the textarea field size, or controls the appearance of the table in which the options of a radio type will be displayed (only columns can be specified -- rows are automatically adjusted, depending on your column specification).</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Venue</h3><p>The <i>Venue</i> tab contains fields for describing where the session takes place.  This information can be entered into the fields, or a venue from the <b>Venues Manager</b> can be selected from the <i>Common Venues</i> pull-down menu.  If associated with an existing venue, the contents of the session's venue fields are ignored.</p>
