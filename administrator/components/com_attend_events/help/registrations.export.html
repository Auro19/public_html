	<p>The Registrations Export page provides additional options to specify how the data contained in the registrations (selected from the Registration Manager page) should be exported.  Select a registration format and specify the name of the file in which the results should be saved (without extension -- this will be added automatically).  <b>Note</b>:  Only "comma separated value" (CSV) is supported presently.<p>
	<h3>Combining Registration Fields over Multiple Sessions</h3><p>Usually, only registrations for a particular session will be exported simultaneously.  However, a group of registrations from multiple sessions can be exported simultaneously.  In this case, the exported data will combine all dynamic fields (based on their names) into a single set of columns.  For instance, if Session A only has dynamic fields "address" and "city", and Session B only has dynamic fields "address" and "state", the combined columns will be:  "address", "city" and "state".  Rows for registrations of Session A will have empty data in the "state" column, while rows corresponding to Session B will have empty "city" columns.  Finally, the "address" information from each session's registration field will be saved into the "address" column regardless of that field's type -- i.e., "address" could be a "text" field in Session A, while "address" in Session B could be a particular "radio" option.</p>
