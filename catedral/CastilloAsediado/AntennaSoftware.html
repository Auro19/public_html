4nec2 is a completely free Nec2, Nec4 and windows based tool for creating, viewing, optimizing and checking 2D and 3D style antenna geometry structures and generate, display and/or compare near/far-field radiation patterns for both the starting and experienced antenna modeler.<br>
<br>
When running frequency sweeps, linear or logarithmic style SWR, Gain, F/B-ratio and impedance line-charts are produced. With the included Optimizer and Sweeper one is able to optimize antenna- and/or other environment-variables for Gain, resonance, SWR, efficiency and/or F/B, F/R-ratio. With the sweeper one is able to graphically display the effect of changing one or more of these variables for a specified range of values/frequencies.<br>
<br>
For the starting modeler a graphically based 3D geometry-editor is included which requires no additional NEC knowledge while still enabling you to create and visualize and compare current-distribution, far/near-field patterns and Gain/SWR charts. More experienced modelers can use the gradient style and/or the genetic algorithm based optimizers to improve their designs.<br>

Is an antenna-analyzing tool based on the moment method, which was introduced in MININEC. The program provides ability for changing the language of signs and messages of the program. In addition to English (default), Russian (more information about Russian MMANA available on DL2KQ's website: http:\\www.dl2kq.de) and Bulgarian, five more languages have been added with the new release. You now have the additional choice of German (by Alex Schewelew, DL1PBD and Ulrich Weiss, DJ2YA), [more information about German MMANA-GAL available on website: http://dl2kq.de/mmana/4-7.htm], Japanese (by Nobuyuki Oba, JA7UDE), Spanish (by Valentin Alonso Gracia, EA4GG & Dimitri Aguero, F4DYT), Serbian (by Slobodan Ilic' YU1GV), and Czech (by Martin Kratoska, OK1RR) user languages.<br>
<br>
Users can easily write a file in their own language by editing the English one. This means, MMANA will be able to communicate with an user in ANY language, actually in the language of his operation system, and that users will be able to write language files themselves. Besides, a user is now able to edit the program's signs, messages and Help file in his own language.<br>
